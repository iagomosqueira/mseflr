=Using TortoiseSVN=

TortoiseSVN is a simple to use, Open Source tool for the Subversion version control system that is employed by GoogleCode.  It integrates neatly with Windows explorer making it a good choice for checking out, updating and committing changes to the code repository.

Here we demonstrate how to install and use it.  Detailed instructions on it's use can be found at the [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN website]

== Installing TortoiseSVN ==

TortoiseSVN can be downloaded from [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads here].  Select the version you want (probably the 32 bit msi installer file) and download it.  Simply double click on the file to run it and install the application.  After installation you may need to restart your computer.

== Checking out a project ==

To use TortoiseSVN open up Windows explorer and navigate to the directory that you will checkout the project into.  Pressing the right mouse button will bring up the usual explorer menu but now with two extra icons: SVN Checkout... and TortoiseSVN

Click on the _SVN Checkout_ icon and a Checkout window will open:

=== Finding the URL ===

The URL of the project needs to be filled in.  This can be found from the GoogleCode project page, under the _Source_ tab where it has instructions on how to checkout the code:

http://lh3.ggpht.com/drfinlayscott/SHc_1cfOmqI/AAAAAAAAAQY/701gFzkt3Rc/s800/TSVNsource.png

The instructions are for a command line SVN client.  We are not interested in all of the commands, only in the URL of the project.

Checking out can be carried out anonymously or as a project member.

==== Anonymous checkout ====

Anonymous checkout does not require an account but means that you will not be able to commit changes.  To do this follow the URL for anonymous checkout.  For example, the URL for this project is: http://mseflr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 
Just cut and paste this address into the checkout window.

==== Project member checkout ====

For project members, the URL is almost the same but it uses _https_ rather than _http_: https://mseflr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

If checking out as a project member you will then be prompted for your GoogleCode username and password.  These can be found under the _Profile_ section of GoogleCode (link is at top right of the page).  The password is automatically generated and is found under the _Settings_ tab of the _Profile_ page (if you already had a Google account, for example for e-mail, the GoogleCode password will be different to your normal password).

=== Proxies ===

If your network uses a proxy server (like at Cefas) then you will also need to set proxy settings.  These can be set by right clicking in explorer and selecting the _TortoiseSVN_ -> _Settings_ option.  Go under the _Network_ tab and enter the proxy settings.
